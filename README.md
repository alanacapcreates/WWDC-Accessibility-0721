# WWDC-Accessibility-0721

## Main Objective

The goal of this challenge is to make existing code more accessible to those with disabilities.

## Color

The main colors used were a light green (#C2E0B1) , dark green (#3F5F50) , black , and red.

To prove this passes accessibility guidelines, I referred to: https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ . 

The contrast between the light green background and black font color passes with a ratio of 14.59:1

On hover, the the input fields and submit button show the dark green color, which, against the light green background, also passes the accessibility test with a ratio of 4.92:1 

## Readability

To assist those with visual impairments, I made sure to include alt text on the .hero image and aria labels on the inout elements. This will help the user understand the page structure when using a screen reader.

In addition to alt text and aria labels, I included the Google Material Icon set (https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons+Outlined) as placeholder text in the input fields. Aside from the text labels above the input field, these graphics are another way for the user to understand the purpose of each interactive element, if for any reason they are unable to understand the text.
